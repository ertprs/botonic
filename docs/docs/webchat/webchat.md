Bots developed with Botonic can be easily deployed to different messaging channels.
Indeed, Botonic's components are specifically treated in order to be executed in a server environment such as Node.Js.
As they are based on React, Botonic components are the perfect fit in order to offer you applications such as Webchat. Webchat is a system that allows you to embed your bots in a web page without requiring any third-party messaging provider.

Example where embedded Webchats can be triggered by clicking the chat bubble:
